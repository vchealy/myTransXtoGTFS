Field Name	Type	Required	Description
table_name	Enum	Required	
Defines the dataset table that contains the field to be translated. The following values are allowed:

agency
stops
routes
trips
stop_times
feed_info
Note: Don't include the .txt file extension after the table's name.
field_name	Text	Required	
Provides the name of the field to be translated. Fields with the type "Text" can be translated, while fields with the types "URL," "Email," and "Phone number" can be included here to provide those resources in the correct language.

Note: Fields with other types are ignored and will not be translated.
language	Language code	Required	
Provides the language of translation.

If this language is the same as the one from feed_lang in feed_info.txt, the original value of the field is the default value used in languages without specific translations.

For example, in Switzerland, a city in a bilingual canton is officially called "Biel/Bienne," but it would simply be called "Bienne" in French and "Biel" in German.

translation	Text, URL, Email, or Phone number	Required	Provides the translated value for the specified field_name.
record_id	ID	Conditionally Required	
Defines the record that corresponds to the field to be translated. The value in record_id needs to be a main ID from a dataset table, as defined in the following table:

table_name	record_id
agency	agency_id
stops	stop_id
routes	route_id
trips	trip_id
stop_times	trip_id
pathways	pathway_id
levels	level_id
The following conditions determine how this field can be used:

Forbidden if table_name equals feed_info.
Forbidden if field_value is defined.
Required if field_value is empty.
record_sub_id	ID	Conditionally Required	
Helps to translate the record that contains the field when the table referenced in record_id doesnâ€™t have a unique ID. The value in record_sub_id is the secondary ID of a dataset table, as defined in the following table:

table_name	record_sub_id
agency	NONE
stops	NONE
routes	NONE
trips	NONE
stop_times	stop_sequence
pathways	NONE
levels	NONE
The following conditions determine how this field can be used:

Forbidden if table_name equals feed_info.
Forbidden if field_value is defined.
Required if table_name equals stop_times and record_id is defined.
field_value	Text, URL, Email, or Phone number	Conditionally Required	
Instead of using record_id and record_sub_id to define which record needs to be translated, field_value can be used to define the value for translation. When used, the translation is applied when the field identified by table_name and field_name contains the exact same value defined in field_value.

The field must exactly match the value defined in field_value. If only a subset of the value matches field_value, the translation isn't applied.

If two translation rules match the same record, one with field_value and the other one with record_id, then the rule with record_id is the one that needs to be used.

The following conditions determine how this field can be used:

Forbidden if table_name equals feed_info.
Forbidden if record_id is defined.
Required if record_id is empty.
