# myTransXtoGTFS
Complete Rewrite of a script I found, as it didn't work I started from scratch


The other scripts didn't fit the bill so I have taken one and hand coded it from the ground up and figured out the faults I found in relation
to the input file I was using.

There are still issues with the Route Extraction and I will work on this next. Then move onto the other required files.
As not all of the required GTFS files have been extracted yet.
